Previous research has proposed the point on how to measure the quality of nursing home service. But traditional service relies on manual investigation which present serval problems like the process of rating quality is complex and insufficient. For the above problems, Collie focus on supporting users to assess the quality of nursing home service. Within the service assessment, we develop a serial of algorithms to deal with different dataset. But more importantly, different database has different features, a group of algorithms is not enough to fulfill users demand. Therefore, we propose a system which enables users choose highly competitive algorithms to solve their problem. To support the core idea, we provide a high performance infrastructure features asynchronous I/O, fast and error tolerant data pipeline. Through a series of experiments, we show that our system outperforms the baseline significantly in terms of system performance, algorithm accuracy.

Previous work for emotion recognition have mostly focused on the extraction of carefully hand-crafted and tailored features. Recently, spectrogram representations of emotion speech have achieved competitive per- formance for automatic speech emotion recognition. In this work we propose a method to tackle the problem of deep features, herein denoted as deep spectrum features, extraction from the spectrogram by leveraging Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Mem- ory Recurrent Neural Networks with fully convolutional networks. The learned deep spectrum features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the final emotion. The proposed model is then evaluated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Cap- ture (IEMOCAP) dataset to validate its effectiveness. Promising results indicate that our deep spectrum representations extracted from the proposed model perform the best, 65.2% for weighted accuracy and 68.0% for unweighted accuracy when compared to other existing methods. We then compare the performance of our deep spectrum features with two standard acoustic feature repre- sentations for speech-based emotion recognition. When combined with a support vector classifier, the performance of the deep feature representations extracted are comparable with the conventional features. Moreover, we also investigate the impact of different fre- quency resolutions of the input spectrogram on the performance of the system.\nCite @inproceedings{Zhao:2018:DSF:3267935.3267948, author = {Zhao, Ziping and Zhao, Yiqin and Bao, Zhongtian and Wang, Haishuai and Zhang, Zixing and Li, Chao}, title = {Deep Spectrum Feature Representations for Speech Emotion Recognition}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Joint Workshop of the 4th Workshop on Affective Social Multimedia Computing and First Multi-Modal Affective Computing of Large-Scale Multimedia Data}, series = {ASMMC-MMAC'18}, year = {2018}, isbn = {978-1-4503-5985-6}, location = {Seoul, Republic of Korea}, pages = {27--33}, numpages = {7}, url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3267935.3267948}, doi = {10.1145/3267935.3267948}, acmid = {3267948}, publisher = {ACM}, address = {New York, NY, USA}, keywords = {attention mechanism, bidirectional long short-term memory, fully convolutional networks, spectrogram representation, speech emotion recognition}, }  ","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"b49aa009b2140b0168240b0d65c0da18","permalink":"/accomplishment/zhaoyiqin-pub-deepsp/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/accomplishment/zhaoyiqin-pub-deepsp/","section":"accomplishment","summary":"Oral paper on ACM Multimedia 2018 ASMMC-MMAC workshop.","tags":["Publication","Affective Computing"],"title":"[Publication] Deep Spectrum Feature Representations for Speech Emotion Recognition","type":"accomplishment"},{"authors":["Sen Li"],"categories":null,"content":"This contest is held at Nanjing,China , Inc to all students over the great China area.\n","date":1534723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534723200,"objectID":"0d5c1e3d3afd32712b9c31a3368b84ef","permalink":"/accomplishment/lisen-awd-cadc/","publishdate":"2018-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/accomplishment/lisen-awd-cadc/","section":"accomplishment","summary":"This contest is held at Nanjing,China , Inc to all students over the great China area.","tags":["Award","CADC·2018","Aircraft"],"title":"[Award] CADC 2018 China Aeromodelling Design Challenge · The First Prize","type":"accomplishment"},{"authors":["ShaoWei Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"Based on raspberry pie and Wechat applet, this project realizes the functions of roadblock detection, assistant obstacle avoidance, navigation and positioning.

Previous approaches to emotion recognition have mostly focused on the extraction of carefully hand-crafted features. How to model spatio-temporal dynamics for speech emotion recognition effectively is still under active investigation. In this paper, we propose a method to tackle the problem of emotional relevant feature extraction from speech by leveraging Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks with fully convolutional networks in order to automatically learn the best spatio-temporal representations of speech signals. The learned high-level features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the final emotion. The experimental results on the Chinese Natural Audio-Visual Emotion Database (CHEAVD) and the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) corpora show that our method provides more accurate predictions compared with other existing emotion recognition algorithms.\nCite @inproceedings{Zhao2018, author={Ziping Zhao and Yu Zheng and Zixing Zhang and Haishuai Wang and Yiqin Zhao and Chao Li}, title={Exploring Spatio-Temporal Representations by Integrating Attention-based Bidirectional-LSTM-RNNs and FCNs for Speech Emotion Recognition}, year=2018, booktitle={Proc.
