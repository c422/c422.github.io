Previous work for emotion recognition have mostly focused on the extraction of carefully hand-crafted and tailored features. Recently, spectrogram representations of emotion speech have achieved competitive per- formance for automatic speech emotion recognition. In this work we propose a method to tackle the problem of deep features, herein denoted as deep spectrum features, extraction from the spectrogram by leveraging Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Mem- ory Recurrent Neural Networks with fully convolutional networks. The learned deep spectrum features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the final emotion. The proposed model is then evaluated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Cap- ture (IEMOCAP) dataset to validate its effectiveness. Promising results indicate that our deep spectrum representations extracted from the proposed model perform the best, 65.2% for weighted accuracy and 68.0% for unweighted accuracy when compared to other existing methods. We then compare the performance of our deep spectrum features with two standard acoustic feature repre- sentations for speech-based emotion recognition. When combined with a support vector classifier, the performance of the deep feature representations extracted are comparable with the conventional features. Moreover, we also investigate the impact of different fre- quency resolutions of the input spectrogram on the performance of the system.\n","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"b49aa009b2140b0168240b0d65c0da18","permalink":"/accomplishment/zhaoyiqin-pub-deepsp/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/accomplishment/zhaoyiqin-pub-deepsp/","section":"accomplishment","summary":"Oral paper on ACM Multimedia 2018 ASMMC-MMAC workshop.","tags":["Publication","Affective Computing"],"title":"[Publication] Deep Spectrum Feature Representations for Speech Emotion Recognition","type":"accomplishment"},{"authors":["Yiqin Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":" PDF\nAbstract Automatic emotion recognition from speech, which is an important and challenging task in the field of affective computing, heavily relies on the effectiveness of the speech features for classification. Previous approaches to emotion recognition have mostly focused on the extraction of carefully hand-crafted features. How to model spatio-temporal dynamics for speech emotion recognition effectively is still under active investigation. In this paper, we propose a method to tackle the problem of emotional relevant feature extraction from speech by leveraging Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks with fully convolutional networks in order to automatically learn the best spatio-temporal representations of speech signals. The learned high-level features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the final emotion. The experimental results on the Chinese Natural Audio-Visual Emotion Database (CHEAVD) and the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) corpora show that our method provides more accurate predictions compared with other existing emotion recognition algorithms.\nCite @inproceedings{Zhao2018, author={Ziping Zhao and Yu Zheng and Zixing Zhang and Haishuai Wang and Yiqin Zhao and Chao Li}, title={Exploring Spatio-Temporal Representations by Integrating Attention-based Bidirectional-LSTM-RNNs and FCNs for Speech Emotion Recognition}, year=2018, booktitle={Proc.
